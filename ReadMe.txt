 About the program:
 
 The program is developed to understatnd how to communcate between the server side and the client side.

 To understand how the server side and client side works, we devided the program files which are the httpRequest 

 and the httpResponse to run the file individually.

 Also, we created a multi-thread function which is allowed us to run the server with various users simultaneously.
